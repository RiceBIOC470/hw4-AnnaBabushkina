%2. - Do the inclass assignment (inclass 10). Here only include your
%answers to the questions a and b there. 


%3. - Use the data from part 1 of this homework. Pool all the data into one
% large matrix regardless of the labelled cell type. 
%A. Run PCA on your dataset. (a) Make plots of PC1 vs PC2, PC1 vs PC3, and
% PC2 vs PC3 in which each point is a different cell. 
% B. Run k-means clustering on this dataset. Try different numbers of
% clusters ranging from 3 to 50 (you don't need to try every number, just 
% sample from this range). In each case, make a plot of PC1 vs PC2 where
% the points are color-coded by cluster. What number of clusters best
% represents the data? Why? 
% C. Make a plot of PC1 vs PC2 but this type color-coded by the annotated
% cell types from the paper. Comment on how this compares to your plots
% from B.
